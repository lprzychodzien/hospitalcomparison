# Preliminary Proposal

## High level description of project.
CMS recently required all hospitals to release their charge master data (how much they charge for things) and many institutions are claiming that their increased prices are due to increased qualty of care. I plan to bring together the cost and quality datasets together for adusted cost comparison model. 

## What question or problem are you trying to solve?


## How will you present your work?
This will be presented ideally as a search function where you can enter an issue and zip code and it will provide you with adjusted estimated costs for your visit at close locations. Additional information can be presented such as highest adjusted cost variability between hopsitals by diagnosis. 

## What are your data sources?
CMS Charge master data: https://www.cms.gov/Research-Statistics-Data-and-Systems/Statistics-Trends-and-Reports/Medicare-Provider-Charge-Data/Inpatient.html 
Hospital Comparison Data: https://data.medicare.gov/data/archives/hospital-compare 

## Whatâ€™s your next step towards making this your project.
Figuring out how to bring the data together correctly and finding additional disgnosis code description data will be the initial step. Adjusting the cost based on quality measures and grouping expected diagnosis codes together into searchable topics. 

## Probably getting the data.
The data is available but extremely messy as the two datasets have no common parameters. Furthermore, the cost data is seperated by diagnosis codes which are technical and I would need to find a description data source to make it search friendly.
